Programs using HFuse should be compiled with -threaded.

HelloFS seems to work with:
* Linux 2.6.24
* The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.8.2
* fuse-2.6

BindFS (?) is known to have a lurking deadlock problem.

LiveFS is broken (from the old distribution).

Added support for MacFUSE. Tested HelloFS and BindFS with:
* OSX 10.4.11 on a PPC G4 mac
* GHC 6.8.3
* MacFUSE 10.4-1.7.0
